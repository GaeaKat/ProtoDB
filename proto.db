_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#:10:21
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/1:10:Using ComSys by Moose, you are able to create your own channels to chat with groups of people that share similiar interests, are from the same series, or any other use that comes to mind.
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/10:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/11:10:To see what channels are available for you to join, simply type '@clist'.
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/12:10:There will be certain flags displayed for each channel on the list, which are:
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/13:10:  P - Public. Anyone can join.
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/14:10:  A - Connects/disconnects/joins/departs are announced.
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/15:10:  T - Transmitable. Anyone can talk on the channel once joining.
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/16:10:  O - You own that channel, or are a wizard.
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/17:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/18:10:There are means of banning unwanted players from joining channels, as well as ways to restrict who can join channels.
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/19:10:Note that you can be subscribed to as many channels at a time as you want.
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/2:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/20:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/21:10:Help File by Akari
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/3:10:To make your own channel, type '@ccreate <channel name>'.
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/4:10:You, and anyone else, can then join the channel by typing:
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/5:10:addcom <alias>=<channel name>
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/6:10:Alias is what player type in order to use the channel. So, for example, if I was joining a public channel, I might type: addcom pup=public
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/7:10:which would subscribe me to the public channel and allow me to send messages through it by typing 'pub <message>'.
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/8:10:Channel owners can type '@cedit <channel name>' in order to configure how the channel works. When you're done with a channel, you can type '@cdestroy <channel name>'.
_tutor/msgs/Channels/msg#/9:10:For a list of all the channel commands, type 'comsys'. Typing 'comsys <command>' will get you a bit of help information about that specific command.
_tutor/msgs/Channels/subject:10:How to make channels for you to use.
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#:10:40
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/1:10:MUCK Communication Options
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/10:10: Both say and pose are only seen by those in the immediate room.
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/11:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/12:10:Whisper is how you communicate secretly with players in the same room as you. The format is:
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/13:10:whisper <player name>=<message>
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/14:10:You can also whisper pose:
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/15:10:whisper <player name>=:<message>
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/16:10:You can also whisper to multiple people in the same room as you by separating all of the player's names by a space. The program remembers who you whispered to last, so if you are continuously whispering to the same people, you do not have to type all of their names in each time. Whisper is only seen by the people you include in your list of names.
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/17:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/18:10:Mumble is much like whisper, though is intended more for IC use. The format for mumble is like whisper:
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/19:10:mumble <player name>=<message>
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/2:10:There are several methods of communication on the MUCK. This document is to help you get familiar with the various options available, with some ideas about how it may be appropriate to put them to use.
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/20:10:However, you can only mumble to one player at a time. The player you mumble to will see the exact contents of your message, whereas the rest of the players in the room will see only portions of it, with many words replaced by several periods, leaving them to try and guess at what was actually said. The random nature of mumble makes for some potentially interesting things happening.
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/21:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/22:10:Page is how you communicate directly with other players on the MUCK, either in the same room as you, or in any other room. The format is familiar:
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/23:10:page <player or players>=<message>
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/24:10:You can also page-pose:
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/25:10:page <player or players>=:<message>
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/26:10:As long as they are connected, and you are not blocked from paging them, then you can contact them via page. While it may be appropriate to page all of your friends hello upon connecting to the MUCK, it is considered inappropriate by many to carry on a lengthy conversation with several players at once via page. Look into channels for that sort of communication.
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/27:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/28:10:If a player is not connected, you can contact them via page #mail. Type:
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/29:10:page #mail <player>=<message>
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/3:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/30:10:Or if your page #mail needs to be formatted, or is a bit longer than a few lines, you can type:
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/31:10:page #mail <player>, then hit enter, and use the lseditor to send the page. See the tutor file on lsedit if you are unfamiliar with it.
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/32:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/33:10:Channels are a way for you to be in contact with several players at once on the MUCK, all at one time, without having to go through the process of mass paging them. To make your own channel, type:
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/34:10:@ccreate <channel name>
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/35:10:To see what channels are already made, type '@clist'.
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/36:10:To join an existing channel, type:
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/37:10:addcom <your short cut for the channel>=<channel name>
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/38:10:Upon connecting to a channel, you can use the shortcut to say or pose into the channel, just like most of the other communication tools on the muck. Type 'comsys' for additional details on the channels system. Channels may be used for IC or OOC purposes, but it's a good idea to distinguish which when making a channel, so that you do not have conflicting objectives attempting to be carried out on it.
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/39:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/4:10:First and foremost are the say and pose commands. Say is done by typing:
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/40:10:-Akari
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/5:10: say <message> or '<message> or "<message>
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/6:10:Pose is done by typing:
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/7:10: pose <message>, :<message>, or ;<message>
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/8:10:OOC communication is done by typing:
_tutor/msgs/Communication/msg#/9:10: osay <say message>, opose <pose message>, ooc <say message>, or ooc :<pose message>
_tutor/msgs/Communication/subject:10:Various tools for players to communicate in-muck
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#:10:63
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/1:10:So you just got yourself a character and you want to type in a nice
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/10:10:How to get around this annoyance?  How to get a longer description?
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/11:10:The answer is simple.  Use lsedit lists.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/12:10: 
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/13:10:< cue dramatic music >
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/14:10: 
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/15:10:An lsedit list is a series of properties stored on some object. This
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/16:10:list can be read and displayed a number of different ways which will be
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/17:10:explained later.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/18:10: 
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/19:10: 
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/2:10:long description of yourself so that everyone knows what you look like.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/20:10: 
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/21:10:The syntax to create an lsedit list is:
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/22:10:   lsedit <object>=<listname>
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/23:10:<object> can be a dbref, object name, or the words "me" or "here".
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/24:10:"me" refers to your player object, "here" refers to the room you are
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/25:10:in.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/26:10:<listname> can be any text you want.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/27:10:Some examples of lsedit:
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/28:10:   lsedit me=mydesc       - this will create a list called
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/29:10:                            "mydesc" on your player object.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/3:10: 
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/30:10:   lsedit me=_desc/human  - will create a list called "_desc/human"
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/31:10:                            on your player object.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/32:10:   lsedit here=roomdesc   - will create a list called "roomdesc"
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/33:10:                            in the current room. (assuming you own the
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/34:10:                            room.)
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/35:10:Once you type in the lsedit command, you will be put placed into
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/36:10:the lseditor which resembles EDLIN for MS-DOS people.  The lseditor
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/37:10:runs in an 'interactive' mode which means that you anything you type
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/38:10:gets sent to the lseditor and not to the muck. So if someone pages you
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/39:10:while you're in the lseditor, your response page will be input as a
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/4:10:The first thing you probably noticed was that you are limited to 4 to 5
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/40:10:line in the lseditor unless you exit the lseditor first.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/41:10: 
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/42:10:In lsedit, each line can have up to 4096 characters or as many
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/43:10:characters as your terminal will allow you to type.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/44:10:If you press enter, it will advance to the next line.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/45:10:There are a number of commands in lseditor that are used by entering
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/46:10:them on a line by themselves.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/47:10:To get a list of commands, type '.h' and press enter.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/48:10:'.end' will save any text you type in and exit the editor.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/49:10:'.abort' will exit the editor without saving the text.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/5:10:lines of text or about 512 characters.  Most standard telnet programs
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/50:10:'.l' will list what you have typed so far.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/51:10:'.p' will list what you have typed with line numbers.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/52:10:'.del linenumber' will delete that line.
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/53:10: 
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/54:10:There are a number of options available for how you type in
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/55:10:descriptions. There are two recommendations I have. The first is to
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/56:10:type your description out completely and then use the command, '.format
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/57:10:1 $' at the end. This will automatically format break your text into
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/58:10:separate lines of 72 columns each with wordwrapping. The second is two
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/59:10:have each sentence on a separate line, ie. press enter after each
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/6:10:have this as a limit.  The other thing you noticed was that if you made
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/60:10:period. This allows for easier editing, but also requires that you use
_tutor/msgs/LSedit/msg#/61:10:a certain method to display the list.

_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/11:10:street."  If "Confucious" walks through the exit, he will see the succ

_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/13:10:<omessage> is a convention followed by most programs that take omessage
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/14:10:fields.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/15:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/16:10:  The behavior of these messages varies depending if they are set on a
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/17:10:room, person, thing, or action.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/18:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/19:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/2:10:  ==============================
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/20:10:  The succ and fail messages depend on whether an object is @locked.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/21:10:  succ and osucc are displayed if you pass the lock on an object.  For a
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/22:10:room, succ is displayed when you successfully look around the room.  For
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/23:10:a player, it is displayed when you successfully rob him.  For an object,
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/24:10:it is displayed when you pick it up.  For an exit or action, it is
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/25:10:displayed when you pass through the exit or perform the action.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/26:10:  fail and ofail are conversely displayed if you do not pass the lock on
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/27:10:an object.  For a room, fail is displayed when you "look" and can't pass
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/28:10:the lock on the room.  For a player, it is displayed when you fail in a
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/29:10:robbery attempt.  For a thing, it is displayed when you are unable to
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/3:10:  You've probably noticed that there are three groups of messages that
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/30:10:pick it up.  For an action or exit, it is displayed when you can not use
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/31:10:the exit or perform the action.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/32:10:  drop and odrop have very varying behavior.  The drop message is
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/33:10:displayed for a room when an object is dropped in it.  For a player,
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/34:10:drop is shown when he is killed.  For a thing, drop is shown when it is
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/35:10:dropped.  For an exit, it is displayed when the person using the exit
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/36:10:enters the room the exit is linked to.  For actions, the drop messages
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/37:10:have no defined behavior though they are used by some programs.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/38:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/39:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/4:10:can be set on objects.  These are the fail and ofail, drop and odrop, and

_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/41:10:=== succ and osucc are shown if
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/42:10:room:   a person 'look's at a room and passes the lock.

_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/44:10:thing:  a person 'get's or 'take's an object and passes the lock.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/45:10:exit:   a person attempts to use an exit and passes the lock.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/46:10:action: a person tries to perform an action and passes the lock.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/47:10:=== fail and ofail are shown if
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/48:10:room:   a person 'look's at a room and doesn't pass the lock.

_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/52:10:action: a person tries to perform an action and can't pass the lock.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/53:10:=== drop and odrop are shown if
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/54:10:room:   a person 'drop's and object in that room.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/55:10:player: a person successfully 'kill's the player.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/56:10:thing:  a person 'drop's the object.
_tutor/msgs/Mesg & OMesg/msg#/57:10:exit:   a person successfully uses the exit. They will be shown in the

_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#:10:42
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/1:10:Note: this file is intended to be read after the tutorial on 'lsedit'.
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/10:10:MPI has a number of commands built in that can parse and read lsedit
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/11:10:lists.  The two we will use are {list:} and {concat:}.  The syntax is
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/12:10:{list:<listname>} and {concat:<listname>}.
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/13:10:Examples on usage:
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/14:10:  @desc me={list:mydesc}          will show 'mydesc' when people look at
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/15:10:                                  you.
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/16:10:  @desc me={concat:_descs/human}  will show '_descs/human' when people
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/17:10:                                  look at you.
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/18:10:  @desc here={list:roomdesc}      will show 'roomdesc' when someone
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/19:10:                                  looks at the room.
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/2:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/20:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/21:10:The difference between the two functions is that {list:} shows each
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/22:10:lsedit line straight with no formatting.  {concat:} will process the
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/23:10:list by stringing each line into one large line.  It will also format
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/24:10:the line.  If the last character of a line is a period, then it will
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/25:10:insert two spaces, otherwise it will insert one space.
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/26:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/27:10:You can have multiple MPI commands on one line.
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/28:10:Ex: @desc me={list:mydesc} {list:_descs/clothes}  will first show the
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/29:10:'mydesc' list and then show '_descs/clothes' after it.
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/3:10:MPI stands for Message Parsing Interpreter and is a very flexible
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/30:10:If you want to force a blank line, you can use the {nl} command between
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/31:10:{list:} and {concat:} commands.
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/32:10:For example, @desc me={list:mydesc}{nl}{list:_descs/clothes}
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/33:10:If you want to have a blank line in the middle of a desc (this usually
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/34:10:happens with {concat:}), putting {nl} by itself won't work.  In this
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/35:10:case it is necessary to put an {eval:} command around the {list:} or
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/36:10:{concat:}.
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/37:10:Ex: @desc me={eval:{list:mydesc}}{eval:{list:_descs/clothes}}   or
_tutor/msgs/MPI Descs/msg#/38:10:    @desc me={eval:{list:mydesc}{list:_descs/clothes}}

_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#:10:41
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/1:10:          SECTION I: "What is MPI, and why should I use it?"
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/10:10:The official name for it, is Message Parsing Interpreter.  That sounds a
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/11:10:lot more ostentatious, and looks better on a resume'.  =)
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/12:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/13:10:MPI is a script language that lets you embed commands within plain text,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/14:10:to do things like substitute in the text value of a property.  It's used
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/15:10:in messages like @descs, @succs, @fails, @drops, @osuccs, @ofails, @odrops,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/16:10:and your 'sex' property.  Those of you who use the $desc, $wf-desc,or @6800
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/17:10:programs are likely familiar with this sort of idea.  MPI works like those
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/18:10:programs, only much faster, and with many more possibilities.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/19:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/2:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/20:10:So, what's in it for you to use MPI?  Well, you can make descriptions
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/21:10:longer than the 512 character input limit, by splitting them up into
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/22:10:sections that are in different properties, and substituting them into
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/23:10:your main @desc.  This also makes it easier to update only one part of
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/24:10:the description, such as what you are wearing, by changing only the
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/25:10:property that has your clothes described.  You can also make multiple
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/26:10:line descriptions, by making a list with lsedit, or another list editor,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/27:10:and using the MPI command to display a list in your @desc.  For those of
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/28:10:you who want to get fancy, you can make your description depend on what
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/29:10:you are carrying.  For example, you can make your description mention
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/3:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/30:10:that you are wearing sunglasses, only if you are actually carrying them.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/31:10:The possibilities are endless.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/32:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/33:10:Because the commands are read and interpreted by the game itself, they
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/34:10:run quickly, producing less lag for the game than the MUF description
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/35:10:programs like @6800.  Also, you can port your descriptions for objects
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/36:10:between fb5.0 MUCKs, without having to worry if the other muck has the
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/37:10:right MUF programs, or uses the same list styles.  You can also get much
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/38:10:fancier with MPI than you can with @6800, since there are many more
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/39:10:commands available to you.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/4:10:So, you've heard about this thing called MPI and you've been told that it
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/40:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/41:10:Okay, okay, that's enough evangelizing..  Lets get onto the next section.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/5:10:can do all sorts of neat things, but you still wonder what it is?  Well,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/6:10:I'll tell you..
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/7:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/8:10:MPI is My Personal Insanity.  That's my unofficial name for it.  I must
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/msg#/9:10:have been crazy for having written 3500 lines of C code to implement it.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro1/subject:10:An Introduction to MPI
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#:10:79
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/1:10:              SECTION II: "So what does MPI look like?"
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/10:10:word inside the braces, before the colon, is the name of the MPI command
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/11:10:that you want it to run.  The rest, after the colon, are the arguments,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/12:10:seperated by commas.  MPI commands often take two or three arguments,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/13:10:though some take many more, one, or none at all.  In fact, a lot of MPI
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/14:10:commands can each take multiple different numbers of arguments, using
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/15:10:default values for any arguments that aren't given.  If an MPI command
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/16:10:takes no arguments, you can omit the colon.  Here's some examples of
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/17:10:MPI commands:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/18:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/19:10:    {prop:_clothes,me}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/2:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/20:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/21:10:This example runs the MPI command "prop" with the two arguments "_clothes",
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/22:10:and "me".
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/23:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/24:10:    {nl}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/25:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/26:10:This runs the MPI command named "nl" with no arguments.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/27:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/28:10:If you want to pass a comma as part of an argument, you have to mark it
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/29:10:to say that you really mean for the comma to get passed to the function,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/3:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/30:10:and that it isn't there to seperate arguments.  To mark it this way, you
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/31:10:put a backslash \ in front of it.  The backslash means that the next
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/32:10:character following it has no special meaning, and that it is to be copied
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/33:10:literally.  This makes a comma look like part of an argument, instead of
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/34:10:like an argument seperator.  This is called 'escaping' a character.  You
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/35:10:can also escape an open-brace { to keep it from trying to interpret the
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/36:10:text after it as an MPI command.  Also, you can escape backslashes.  In
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/37:10:fact, to include a backslash in text, you HAVE to escape it.  Almost any
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/38:10:character after a backslash will be copied literally.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/39:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/4:10:MPI has a fairly simple structure, mostly.  It goes like this:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/40:10:The only exception is \r which is replaced by a carriage return character.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/41:10:A carriage return character tells the game to split the text into two lines
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/42:10:at that place, when the text is displayed to the player.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/43:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/44:10:Example:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/45:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/46:10:    {store:\{Here\\now\}\, she thought.,_when}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/47:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/48:10:This will run "store" with the two arguments "{Here\now}, she thought.",
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/49:10:and "_when".  The first backslash \ escapes the open-brace {, copying it
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/5:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/50:10:into the argument literally.  The next backslash escapes the backslash
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/51:10:that follows it, making the backslash copy into the argument literally.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/52:10:The close-brace has to be escaped, also, or else the game would think
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/53:10:that you are trying to run the "store" command with only the argument
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/54:10:"{Here\now".  The comma is escaped to say that it is part of the argument,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/55:10:and not an argument seperator.  The NEXT comma, however, is not escaped.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/56:10:The game sees this and goes, "Aha!  A second argument follows!"  Then it
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/57:10:gets to the last close brace }, and sees that it has gotten all the
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/58:10:arguments.  At this point, it calls "store" with the two arguments that
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/59:10:you passed.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/6:10:    {command:arg1,arg2,arg3...}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/60:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/61:10:Note that several backslashes in a row will escape each other, alternating
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/62:10:between escaping and escaped characters.  What this means is that the game
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/63:10:will take a look at "\\\{" and see an escaped backslash and an escaped
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/64:10:open-brace.  Literally: "\{".  However, it will see "\\\\{" as two escaped
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/65:10:backslashes and a NON-escaped open-brace.  It would try parsing anything
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/66:10:after the non-escaped open-brace as an MPI command.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/67:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/68:10:MPI commands can have MPI commands nested within them, so they can take
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/69:10:the output of other commands and use them as inputs.  Example:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/7:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/70:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/71:10:    {count:{contents:here}}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/72:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/73:10:This would first run the MPI command "contents" with the argument "here".
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/74:10:Then the "count" command would be run with the string returned from the
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/75:10:"contents" command as its single argument.  Commas and other characters
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/76:10:inside strings returned from nested commands will all act like they have
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/77:10:been escaped.  If they didn't, they would cause unexpected problems, as
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/78:10:your commands would find more arguments than they expect!  Luckily, you
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/79:10:won't have to worry about that problem.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/8:10:The open-brace { says that the text until the matching close-brace } is
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro2/msg#/9:10:going to be an MPI command that the game should interpret.  The first

_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/10:10:where the command was.  Example:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/11:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/12:10:    @desc me=You see a pretty young girl with {prop:_haircolor) hair.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/13:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/14:10:When someone looks at you, with that description set, the game will
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/15:10:run the "prop" command with the argument "_haircolor".  The "prop"
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/16:10:command will then look for a property named "_haircolor" on the object
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/17:10:the command is on. It then replaces the call to itself, in the output
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/18:10:text, with the string value of the property.  If the "_haircolor"
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/19:10:property was set to "golden", then the looking player will see
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/2:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/20:10:"You see a pretty young girl with golden hair."
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/21:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/22:10:Unlike the various MUF description programs such as @6800 and $wf-desc,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/23:10:MPI commands can be inside of omessages, such as @ofail, @osucc, and
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/24:10:@odrop.  This lets you do things like make an @osuccess message properly
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/25:10:reflect a varying @succ message.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/3:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/4:10:MPI commands are run from within messages like your @description, your
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/5:10:@success, or your @ofail, to name just three.  You just set the message
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/6:10:like you always used to, but you also include some commands within the
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/7:10:text of the message.  When the message is displayed by the game, it sees
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/8:10:the commands in the text, and runs them.  It takes whatever text they
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/msg#/9:10:may return, and puts that in the text to be displayed, in the place
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro3/subject:10:More on MPI. Using MPI.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#:10:90
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/1:10:           SECTION IV: "Right, so what are the commands?"
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/10:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/11:10:This command looks for a property with the name 'propname' on the given
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/12:10:object.  If it doesn't find it there, it looks down the environment from
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/13:10:the given object.  If no property by than name exists on that object, or
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/14:10:in its environment, then this returns an empty string.  Otherwise, it
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/15:10:returns the string value of the property.  If no 'object' argument is
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/16:10:give, then it assumes that the given object is the trigger object.  The
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/17:10:trigger object is the object that has the MPI commands in a message on it.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/18:10:An example of the use of {prop} is:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/19:10:    @desc me=You see a young woman who is wearing {prop:_clothes}.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/2:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/20:10:    @set me=_clothes:a blue blouse and a short green skirt
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/21:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/22:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/23:10:    {exec:propname,object}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/24:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/25:10:This command is almost exactly like {prop}, except that any MPI commands
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/26:10:within the string value of the property are executed, and for their running,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/27:10:the trigger object will be the object that the property is on.  This lets
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/28:10:you have MPI commands embedded within the properties that store various
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/29:10:parts of your @desc, if your @desc is split up into multiple properties.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/3:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/30:10:An example of the use of {exec} is:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/31:10:    @desc me=You see a young woman who is wearing {exec:_clothes}.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/32:10:    @set me=_clothes:{prop:_clothes/top} and {prop:_clothes/bottom}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/33:10:    @set me=_clothes/top:a blue blouse
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/34:10:    @set me=_clothes/bottom:a short green skirt
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/35:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/36:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/37:10:    {list:listname,object}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/38:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/39:10:This will load in a property list with the given listname, from the
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/4:10:There are a lot of MPI commands that you can use.  Over a hundred of them,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/40:10:given object.  It loads the list as a single string, with each list
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/41:10:item seperated from the next by a carriage return character.  These
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/42:10:carriage return chars will each start a new line, seperating the text
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/43:10:into multple lines, when they are displayed to the user.  A property
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/44:10:list is a set of numbered properties with string values.  For example,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/45:10:a set of properties named "list1", "list2", "list3", etc is a list named
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/46:10:"list".  The {list} command understands several styles of lists, so
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/47:10:"list#/1", "list#/2", etc, and "list/1", "list/2", etc, are both also
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/48:10:recognized by the listname "list".  This means that almost every known
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/49:10:MUF list editor should be able to make a list that {list} can read.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/5:10:in fact, so I'm not going to list them all right now.  I'll just give you
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/50:10:If no object argument is given, this command will assume that the given
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/51:10:object is the trigger object.  The environmental searching for the list
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/52:10:is the same as for {prop}.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/53:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/54:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/55:10:    {concat:listname,object}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/56:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/57:10:This is almost exactly like {list}, except that instead of seperating
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/58:10:list items with carriage returns, it seperates them with spaces.  The
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/59:10:number of spaces depends on how the previous line ends.  If it ends in
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/6:10:a run-through of a few of the most useful and popular ones.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/60:10:a period, question mark, or exclamation mark, it seperates the lines
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/61:10:with two spaces, otherwise, it uses only one.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/62:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/63:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/64:10:    {rand:listname,object}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/65:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/66:10:This is sort of like {list}, except that it will randomly pick a line
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/67:10:from the given named property list and return it, instead of returning
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/68:10:the whole property list.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/69:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/7:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/70:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/71:10:    {timesub:period,offset,listname,object}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/72:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/73:10:This is sort of like {list}, except that it will only return one line
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/74:10:of the given named property list.  The line it chooses depends on the
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/75:10:time.  The period is the length of time, in seconds, that it takes for
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/76:10:{timesub} to cycle through the entire list.  The offset is the number of
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/77:10:seconds to offset into the time period, if you actually need to synchronize
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/78:10:the {timesub} with something.  The offset usually is just left at zero.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/79:10:What this all means, is that if you have, for example, a period of 3600
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/8:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/80:10:(one hour), an offset of zero, and a property list that has six items in
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/81:10:it, then {timesub} will return the first line of the property list during
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/82:10:the first ten minutes of the hour, the second line during the next ten
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/83:10:minutes, and so on, until it returns the last line during the last ten
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/84:10:minutes of the hour.  Then it returns the first line for the beginning
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/85:10:of the next hour.  Here's an example:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/86:10:    {timesub:86400,0,_sunmoon}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/87:10:This example will show different property list lines, depending on the
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/88:10:time of day.  The period is 86400 seconds, which is one day.  If the
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/89:10:property list has 24 items in it, then a different line will be returned
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/9:10:    {prop:propname,object}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/msg#/90:10:for each hour of the day.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro4/subject:10:An introduction to various MPI commands.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#:10:19
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/1:10:            SECTION V: "And just how do I refer to objects?"
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/10:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/11:10:The following are examples of the accepted ways to refer to objects.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/12:10:    object               Referencing by name.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/13:10:    #1234                Referencing by dbref.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/14:10:    $regname             Referencing by registered name.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/15:10:    *playername          Referencing by player name.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/16:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/17:10:When an MPI command returns a reference to an object, (we'll discuss
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/18:10:some of these commands in the intermediate guide) it will refer to
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/19:10:nonplayers by dbref, and to players by starred name.  ("*playername")
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/2:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/3:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/4:10:Okay, you can reference objects in basically the same ways that you can
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/5:10:in user typed commands such as @desc, or @lock.  You can refer to obj-
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/6:10:ects by name, if they are in the same room as you, or in your inventory.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/7:10:You can refer to objects by dbref or registered name, if you need to be
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/8:10:able to refer to the object if it is not in your vicinity.  And you can
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/msg#/9:10:refer to players by name, with a * in front, no matter where they are.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro5/subject:10:Referring to objects in MPI.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#:10:82
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/1:10:        SECTION VI: "Cool.  So how what stuff can I run mpi from?"
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/10:10:going on in the room.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/11:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/12:10:To run MPI commands when a player logs in, you need to make a special
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/13:10:property on the player, or on the room where the player resides.  To do
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/14:10:this, just simply do:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/15:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/16:10:    @set <object>=_connect/XXX:&<mpi goes here>
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/17:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/18:10:The XXX can be anything.  The properties will be evaluated in alphabetical
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/19:10:order.  The result of the mpi code is displayed to the connecting user.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/2:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/20:10:The ampersand (&) that starts the property value tells the server that it
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/21:10:has MPI commands in that property that it should evaluate.  As an example:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/22:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/23:10:    @set here=_connect/room_motd:&{list:_room_motd,here}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/24:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/25:10:This example will show the room's message of the day, that is stored in
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/26:10:the _room_motd property list on the room, to the player logging in.  There
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/27:10:is a different set of properties, with names starting with "_oconnect/",
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/28:10:that also runs when a player connects, but the results of the MPI code
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/29:10:will be shown to the other people in the room, and not the player.  For
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/3:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/30:10:example:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/31:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/32:10:    @set here=_oconnect/herald:&Hear ye, hear ye!  {name:me} has connected!
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/33:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/34:10:Will tell everyone in the room that someone just connected in the room,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/35:10:in a somewhat heraldic fashion.  =)
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/36:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/37:10:When a player logs off from the muck, the properties under the _disconnect
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/38:10:and _odisconnect propdirs are evaluated in a similar fashion.  When a
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/39:10:player leaves a room, the properties under the _depart and _odepart
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/4:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/40:10:propdirs are evaluated.  When a player enters a room, the properties
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/41:10:under the _arrive and _oarrive propdirs are evaluated.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/42:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/43:10:Here's some examples:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/44:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/45:10:    @set here=_odisconnect/elvis:&{name:me} has left the muck!
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/46:10:    @set here=_arrive/enter-details:&{list:_entry_details,here}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/47:10:    @set here=_odepart/cabbie:&The cabbie watches {name:me} storm out.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/48:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/49:10:When something is heard in the room, properties in the ~listen and
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/5:10:There's lots of things that'll parse MPI commands.  To start with, the
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/50:10:~olisten propdirs are run, from all things in the room.  The {&arg}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/51:10:variable holds the message that was heard.  For example:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/52:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/53:10:    @set here=~listen/echo:&You hear an echo: {&arg}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/54:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/55:10:That will echo whatever it hears in that room, to the player who made
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/56:10:the noise.  You can also make listeners be restricted to only hearing
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/57:10:certain patterns of words.  To do this, you need to put in a matching
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/58:10:pattern at the beginning of the property value.  The syntax is:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/59:10:@set <obj>=~listen/XXX:<pattern>=&<mpicode>
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/6:10:@desc, @succ, @osucc, @fail, @ofail, @drop, and @odrop messages will all
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/60:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/61:10:For example:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/62:10:@set here=~listen/aod:*Klaatu barada nicto*=&The sky rumbles at You!
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/63:10:@set here=~olisten/aod:*Klaatu barada nicto*=&The sky rumbles at {name:me}!
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/64:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/65:10:This example would have the skies rumbling at any player who said or posed
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/66:10:the words "Klaatu barada nicto" in the room.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/67:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/68:10:You can use MPI in locks, too, but only indirectly.  The way you do it,
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/69:10:is you lock to a property and the result you want, then you make that
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/7:10:parse whatever MPI code you put in them.  Also, when a player connects
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/70:10:property contain the MPI code.  For example, to have a room display its
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/71:10:fail message when there are more than ten people in the room, do this:
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/72:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/73:10:@fail here=The room's rather crowded at the moment.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/74:10:@succ here=The room's not so crowded at the moment.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/75:10:@lock here=_crowdedroom?:no
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/76:10:@set here=_crowdedroom?:{if:{gt:{count:{contents:here}},10},yes,no}
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/77:10: 
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/78:10:In this example, the MPI code in the _crowdedroom? property will return
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/79:10:"yes" if there are  more than ten items in the room.  Otherwise, it will
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/8:10:to the muck, or disconnects, you can run MPI.  Also, when a player moves
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/80:10:return "no".  The lock on the room evaluates that MPI code, and checks
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/81:10:to see if it returned "no".  If it did, then the success is shown to the
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/82:10:player looking at the room.  Otherwise, the @fail is shown to the looker.
_tutor/msgs/MPI-Intro6/msg#/9:10:from room to room.  You can even have MPI code that hears whatever is

_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/22:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/23:10:and your dbref number is 1234, you would actually type:
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/24:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/25:10:@set foo=bar:1234
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/26:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/27:10:Creating a Puppet
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/28:10:=======
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/29:10:The first step in creating a puppet is to create the puppet object
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/3:10:A puppet is an object you create that has a number of special properties
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/30:10:itself. This is accomplished by simply typing:
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/31:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/32:10:@create [puppet's name]
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/33:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/34:10:Once you have the puppet object, you need to turn on it's Z (Zombie) flag.
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/35:10:The Z flag causes an object to report what it 'sees' back to its owner,
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/36:10:unless its owner is in the same room.  To set the Z flag on your puppet:
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/37:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/38:10:@set [puppet's name]=Z
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/39:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/4:10:that allow it to act almost like another character. Puppets report what
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/40:10:You now have an object that will report to you whatever it sees.  Next, we
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/41:10:want to make the puppet respond to your commands.  The first step is to
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/42:10:make the puppet Xforceable. So:
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/43:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/44:10:@set [puppet's name]=X
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/45:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/46:10:And then, set it so that the puppet is 'Force Locked' to you - so only you
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/47:10:can control it:
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/48:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/49:10:@flock [puppet's name]=me
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/5:10:they see to their owner, and can be made to do things by their owner.
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/50:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/51:10:Next, you need to create a control action - though note that you will only
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/52:10:ever need to perform this step once. Create the control action by typing:
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/53:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/54:10:@action control=me
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/55:10:@link control=$null
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/56:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/57:10:This creates the control action, and links it to the $null program. Now
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/58:10:comes the only tricky part - though once again, this step only ever needs
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/59:10:to be performed once. After the creation of your first puppet, you will
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/6:10:They can also be programmed to respond in specific ways to specific
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/60:10:never need to do this again. Set the @succ of the control action as follows:
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/61:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/62:10:@succ control={if:{&arg},{force:{prop:{&cmd}},{&arg}},Usage: {&cmd} <action>}
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/63:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/64:10:Cut and paste that if possible, because typos can easily create errors.
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/65:10:However, the worst is now over. The next two steps must be performed for
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/66:10:each puppet you create. First, choose the name of the action you wish to
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/67:10:use to control the puppet.  This should be short and easy to type and
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/68:10:remember (For example, for a Royal Guard, you might choose rg). Then, once
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/69:10:you have chosen:
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/7:10:events, but that functionality will not be covered in this tutorial.
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/70:10:@aname control=;[name of puppet's control action]
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/71:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/72:10:Be careful not to leave out the ;   It's important.
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/73:10:Finally, you must 'point' the new control action to the puppet:
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/74:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/75:10:@set control=[name of puppet's control action]:#[puppet's dbref number]
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/76:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/77:10:If you don't know the dbref number of the puppet, just ex [puppet's name],
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/78:10:and once again, don't forget to include the # before the dbref number.
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/79:10:There.  You have just created your first puppet. To create more, follow these
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/8:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/80:10:steps:
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/81:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/82:10:@create [puppet's name]
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/83:10:@set [puppet's name]=Z
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/84:10:@set [puppet's name]=X
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/85:10:@flock [puppet's name]=me
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/86:10:@aname control=;[name of puppet's control action]
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/87:10:@set control=[name of puppet's control action]:#[puppet's dbref number]
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/88:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/89:10:And remember - if you have a puppet that you don't use any more, you might
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/9:10:The Goals of this Document
_tutor/msgs/Puppets/msg#/90:10:want to just @name it into a new puppet that will see more use, rather than

_tutor/msgs/Router & Firewall/msg#/1:10:Those of you that connect to MUCKs from behind firewalls or routers may find that if you idle from two to three minutes, your connection will mysteriously die.
_tutor/msgs/Router & Firewall/msg#/10:10:Simply type '/idle 2 unidle' and your client will send the 'unidle' command every time you're idle for two minutes, yet your character won't unidle on the MUCK, so other players don't get confused in thinking you're at the keyboard when you're not.

_tutor/msgs/Router & Firewall/msg#/12:10:- Akari
_tutor/msgs/Router & Firewall/msg#/2:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Router & Firewall/msg#/3:10:There are a couple ways of fixing this:
_tutor/msgs/Router & Firewall/msg#/4:10:#1) Some clients have an option that allows you to send a NOP to the MUCK on some set interval. Setting it to two minutes or less should suffice to keep your connection alive and it won't unidle your character's idle time on the MUCK.
_tutor/msgs/Router & Firewall/msg#/5:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Router & Firewall/msg#/6:10:#2) Forward the ports your MU* client is using to the computer you are using.  This approach of course depends on you having some kind of control over the router or firewall, and also knowing what you're doing in terms of forwarding the ports to your computer.  The disadvantage is that this solution will usually only work for one computer behind the router/firewall, since you'll generally need to forward ports 1024 - 5000, because no MU* client I'm aware of yet allows you to control which ports it uses for outgoing connections.  Don't come to me for help with this option.  Contact your ISP for help in configuring your router, or consult the help documents for your firewall.
_tutor/msgs/Router & Firewall/msg#/7:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Router & Firewall/msg#/8:10:#3) Don't idle for 2 minutes! Naturally, this is hard to do, unless your client has some method of setting up an unidle trigger.  If you are going to use this method, simply have your client send the command 'unidle' to the MUCK, and you will not lose your connection, but your idle time won't be reset as well. This support is available in Proto1.80b4 and newer (Just check @version).

_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#:10:50
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/1:10:A lot of people have asked me how to go about making it so that your room descs
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/10:10:  86400 to correspond to one day) into even parts, so that if you have four
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/11:10:  descriptions (morning, day, evening, night) each one will be displayed for
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/12:10:  six hours. If that's fine with you, then great. Write up the list of
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/13:10:  descriptions you want it to rotate through, then type '@desc
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/14:10:  here={timesub:86400,<offset>,<name of list that holds your descriptions>}'.
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/15:10:  I'll explain offset further down.
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/16:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/17:10:Now some of you might be the type that don't want even periods of time for each
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/18:10:  description. No problem. Here's how you can specify what you want displayed
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/19:10:  each hour of the day. Write up your time sensitive descriptions into separate
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/2:10:  will rotate according to the time of day.  This document is my attempt at
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/20:10:  lists.  Like a list for night, morning, evening, etc.  Then, make a list
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/21:10:  called desc (lsedit here=desc).  In that list, put twenty four lines that
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/22:10:  call the descriptions you just wrote, each line representing an hour of the
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/23:10:  day.  It doesn't matter what hour of the day you start the list off at, just
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/24:10:  as long as you end up with 24. For example, if I've made an 'evening' list,
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/25:10:  and a 'night' list, and starting the 'desc' list with what I consider to be
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/26:10:  6pm, I would write:
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/27:10:{list:evening}
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/28:10:{list:evening}
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/29:10:{list:night}
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/3:10:  trying to explain that in as clear and understandable fashion as possible.
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/30:10:{list:night}
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/31:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/32:10:That means that at 6 and 7pm, my 'evening' description would be displayed. Then
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/33:10:  at around 8pm, it would switch to my 'night' description. I would continue
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/34:10:  until I had 24 lines, each one representing an hour of the day.  Then I would
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/35:10:  '@desc here={timesub:86400,<offset>,desc}'.  At Distant Shores, the Cathedral
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/36:10:  that I described using {timesub:} actually has two sections in the desc that
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/37:10:  change according to the time of day. That's done by simply calling two lists
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/38:10:  per line instead of one. (e.g. {list:morning}{list:services}).
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/39:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/4:10:  o.o; Before going on to read this, type 'mpi timesub'. Timesub is the command
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/40:10:Now for the offset thing.  This is the number of seconds that you want to
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/41:10:  offset the start of your list from the server's time.  Basically a trial and
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/42:10:  error thing, at best. Just keep setting your @desc with offsets in increments
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/43:10:  of one hour ( 3600 seconds) until when you look at the room it matches with
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/44:10:  the time of the day you want it to be.
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/45:10: 
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/46:10:Probably sounds pretty confusing, and the first time you try to do this, it
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/47:10:  might be. But feel free to page me any time I'm around if you get stuck on
_tutor/msgs/Time Descs/msg#/48:10:  something and I'll help you through it. ^^_^^

And if you're an admin, feel free to change the guest settings (and even close off logins) through the use of editing $lib/standard.  Or you can close it off by re-passwording this guest character.  You can do so with the ^WHITE^@newpassword ^NORMAL^command.  Also, if you want a guest to login with any password, you do not have to prvoide a password for the guest.  Eg. '^WHITE^@newpassword Guest^NORMAL^' will remove the need for a password entirely.

desc#/1:10:^NORMAL^You are in Room #0.  This is where all of the global actions are (type '^WHITE^globals^NORMAL^' here to get a list.)
desc#/10:10:  ^WHITE^/_Connect/    ^NORMAL^- For on connect.
desc#/11:10:  ^WHITE^/_Disconnect/ ^NORMAL^- For on disconnect.
desc#/12:10:  ^WHITE^/_Arrive/     ^NORMAL^- When arriving in a new place.
desc#/13:10:  ^WHITE^/_Depart/     ^NORMAL^- When leaving a place.
desc#/14:10:  ^WHITE^/_LookQ/      ^NORMAL^- For when someone looks.  Only usable if you have the @tune option "look_propqueues" set to yes.
desc#/15:10: 
desc#/16:10:^WHITE^NOTE: ^NORMAL^Remember to verify through your '^WHITE^@tune^NORMAL^' options.  To learn how to use @tune, you can type '^WHITE^help @tune^NORMAL^'.
desc#/17:10:^WHITE^NOTE: ^NORMAL^Make sure you edit the MUF $Lib/Standard and change any settings you wish to.  You can get help on the editor by typing '^WHITE^help @edit^NORMAL^'.  Then, when you get in the editor, you can type '^WHITE^h^NORMAL^' to get help inside there.
desc#/18:10: 
desc#/19:10:To get information on each part of MUCKing, you can go through the following: '^WHITE^globals^NORMAL^', '^WHITE^tutor^NORMAL^', '^WHITE^help^NORMAL^', '^WHITE^man^NORMAL^', '^WHITE^info^NORMAL^', '^WHITE^<command> #help^NORMAL^', and '^WHITE^mpi^NORMAL^'.
desc#/2:10: 
desc#/20:10: 
desc#/21:10:^NOTE^Also: ^NORMAL^You may want to look into editing wizlist.  Type '^WHITE^wizlist #help^NORMAL^' for help on it.  You can also easily enough add a staff listing using the same program.  Just create the action, then link it to the MUF program.  Then you can set it up to work however you want it to. :)  This is especially useful for, say, a helpstaff listing.
desc#/3:10:This is also where a lot of programming information is:
desc#/4:10: 
desc#/5:10:^WHITE^MPI Custom Functions ^NORMAL^- These are for users, or yourself, to fiddle with.  They are in the directory ^WHITE^/_MsgMacs/ ^NORMAL^here.  The ones provided for you in the minimal database are: ^WHITE^{!boy?:<db>}^NORMAL^, ^WHITE^{!arch?:<db>}^NORMAL^, ^WHITE^{!wiz?:<db>}^NORMAL^, ^WHITE^{!staff?:<db>}^NORMAL^, ^WHITE^{wiz?:<db>}^NORMAL^, ^WHITE^{staff?:<db>}^NORMAL^, ^WHITE^{places}^NORMAL^, ^WHITE^{places:<place>}^NORMAL^, and ^WHITE^{places:<place>,<command>}^NORMAL^.
desc#/6:10: 
desc#/7:10:^WHITE^MUF Custom Functions ^NORMAL^- These are for programmers to use in their programs.  None are included in the minimal database, as it is good practice not to use these nor macros if avoidable.  They can be placed in the ^WHITE^/_Defs/ ^NORMAL^directory.
desc#/8:10: 
desc#/9:10:^WHITE^Queued Events ^NORMAL^- For programs to run at certain events.  The available ones are as follows:
